        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1" data-line-end="2">Our model is designed to predict whether a Kickstarter campaign will meet its funding goal or not. 
            Using a dataset of Kickstarter campaigns spanning from April 2009 to May 2021, with over 131,000 campaigns represented, we observe a prediction accuracy of 84%.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">The model makes its prediction based on 9 features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6"><strong>Primary Category</strong>: One of the major 15 product categories designated by Kickstarter</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7"><strong>Campaign Goal</strong>: The campaign funding goal</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8"><strong>Staff Pick</strong>: Whether or not the campaign receives a ‘Projects We Love’ badge</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9"><strong>Description Length</strong>: The number of words in the campaign description</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10"><strong>Campaign Length</strong>: The span of time in days between a campaigns launch and end</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11"><strong>Subcategory</strong>: One of 161 product subcategories designated by Kickstarter. (If you do not know your Subcategory you can use your Primary Category here as well.)</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12"><strong>Holiday Season</strong>: Whether the campaign was launched in the busy shopping months of November, December or January</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13"><strong>Campaign Launch</strong> Length: The span of time between creating and launching a campaign</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="15"><strong>Product Name Length</strong>: The number of words in the name of your product</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">After testing a variety of ensemble classifier estimators, our best performing estimator, 
            <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html">the XGBClassifier</a>, was selected to be implemented in this web application. 
            XGBClassifier is an implementation of gradient boosted decision tree classification, which combines the high performance and generality of Random Forest 
            classifiers with gradient descent optimization. The classifier was trained on over 105,000 campaign observations, tested on over 26,000, and achieved an 
            overall accuracy-score of 84% against the testing data. The positive prediction rate was 85% while the negative prediction rate was 79%, so keep in mind 
            that a negative prediction is less accurate than a positive one.

        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">In figure 1 below we can see a plot of the relative importances of our model features. 
            The ‘Staff Pick’ feature appears to be extremely dominant. Indeed, among the 14% of campaigns in our dataset who received a ‘Projects We Love’ badge, 
            91% meet their funding goal. A badge is a 
            <a href="https://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005135214-How-does-my-project-become-a-Project-We-Love-or-get-featured-on-the-homepage-">good thing to get</a> 
            but given to relatively few. However, among the 84% who did not receive badges, 52% still achieved their funding goal. Because badges are awarded after the launch 
            of a campaign, our users will not know whether they will receive one or not at the outset. Because of this, our application makes two predictions: one with a badge 
            awarded and one without a badge awarded. In this way our users can assess the likelihood of campaign success under these two scenarios.

        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="20">In figures 2 through 5 below, we can see plots of how the features in our model contributed to the 
            prediction of campaign success and failure respectively. In figures 2 and 3 we can see a campaign predicted to meet its funding goal in which the the most influential 
            features are positive and associated with the ‘Subcategory’ of ‘Fiction’, followed closely by having received a Staff Pick badge. In figures 4 and 5 we can see a campaign 
            predicted to not meet its funding goal in which the most influential features are negative and associated with the ‘Subcategory’ of ‘Diy’ and the ‘Primary Category’ 
            of ‘Crafts’. If any users would like this kind of personalized prediction analysis please reach-out to Dan F for pricing options.
